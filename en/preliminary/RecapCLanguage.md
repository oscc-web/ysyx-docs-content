# Reviewing the C language

C is the language of choice for developing system software, and considering that many of the students participating in "One Student One Chip" project majored in non-computer science, the learning curve for C is relatively simple. You need to know the following: recursion, pointers, linked lists, and be able to write a correct program on your own (not by searching for a so-called sample code on Google).

:::info[Some recommended materials for learning C]
- [One-stop Learning for Linux C Programming][linux c]
- [The C programming language (2nd Edition)][c]:
  The true creator of the C programming language is [Dennis M. Ritchie][ritchie], the author of this book, not Tan Haoqiang
- [C Coding Standard][c coding standard]
- [SEI CERT C Coding Standard][cert c]
- [Learn C the hard way]

:::info[Some simple C++ fundamentals are also required]
Verilator compiles Verilog to C++, but you don't need to know complex C++ syntax, you just need to know the basics of how to use a class. From this point of view alon.

:::warning[Must-do exercises for getting started with C language]
[Learn C the hard way] Exercise 0 to Exercise 18, Exercise 32, Exercise 33, Exercise 42, Exercise 44. Need to complete programming algorithms and additional exercises.

- This is part of the admissions defense, if you get stuck somewhere you can RTFW or ask a TA.
- Reference materials use the study materials mentioned above.
